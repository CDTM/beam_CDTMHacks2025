**PedalWorks** is a mid-sized bike manufacturer operating across four locations with approximately 500 employees. The company spans six core departments:

* Procurement
* Manufacturing
* Quality Control
* Supply Chain
* HR & Onboarding
* Customer Support

Each team struggles with **repetitive, low-value tasks** that hamper productivity, increase errors, and reduce strategic focus.

### 🎯 Your Challenge:

Pick a real-world problem in any department, and demonstrate how your agent can:

* **Automate with Intelligence:** Deliver a working, end-to-end workflow powered by Beam.
* **Deliver Tangible Impact:** Quantify gains — hours saved, errors reduced, or satisfaction improved.
* **Integrate Seamlessly:** Show how your agent fits into existing tools and processes.

## 🧩 Department Overview + Jobs to Be Done

| **Department**       | **Challenges**                                                                                                                                                      | **Jobs to Be Done (JTBD)**                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Procurement**      | - Manual vendor onboarding and contract reviews delay operations. <br> - Invoice-to-PO matching is error-prone. <br> - Payment processes create bottlenecks.        | - Rapidly onboard vendors and validate contracts with minimal back-and-forth. <br> - Reconcile POs and invoices accurately with minimal effort. <br> - Ensure timely payments and maintain supplier trust. |
| **Manufacturing**    | - Delayed maintenance alerts lead to downtime. <br> - Manual schedule recalculations during demand spikes. <br> - Workforce planning relies on static spreadsheets. | - Act on real-time alerts to prevent equipment failure. <br> - Dynamically adjust production schedules based on live inputs. <br> - Optimize staffing using real-time insights.                            |
| **Quality Control**  | - Backlogs delay product release. <br> - Inconsistent defect tracking limits root-cause analysis.                                                                   | - Accelerate inspections and reduce bottlenecks. <br> - Standardize defect logging to enable actionable trend analysis.                                                                                    |
| **Supply Chain**     | - Poor inventory visibility causes stockouts/overstock. <br> - Forecasting is fragmented and unreliable.                                                            | - Gain real-time visibility across inventory systems. <br> - Generate accurate demand forecasts with integrated data.                                                                                      |
| **HR & Onboarding**  | - New-hire paperwork takes days via email. <br> - Training compliance is manually tracked. <br> - Resume screening is inefficient.                                  | - Automate onboarding workflows to reduce ramp time. <br> - Track certifications centrally. <br> - Use intelligent filters to shortlist candidates quickly.                                                |
| **Customer Support** | - Requests arrive unstructured, requiring manual parsing. <br> - Customer data is spread across tools. <br> - Claim tracking is manual and error-prone.             | - Convert support requests into structured formats automatically. <br> - Give agents full visibility into customer history. <br> - Track and manage claims in a centralized, reliable system.              |
